Installation
--------------

``polyclonal`` requires Python 3.8 or higher.

Unfortunately ``polyclonal`` cannot currently be installed from `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_.
The reason is that ``polyclonal`` currently uses the `GitHub development version of altair <https://github.com/altair-viz/altair/discussions/2588>`_, which has to be installed from GitHub and `PyPI <https://pypi.org/>`_ does not allow GitHub dependencies.
Therefore, for now you have to install ``polyclonal`` from GitHub.
To do this for version 2.4 of ``polyclonal``, you would use this command::

    pip install git+https://github.com/jbloomlab/polyclonal/@2.4#egg=polyclonal

The source code for ``polyclonal`` is available on GitHub at https://github.com/jbloomlab/polyclonal.
