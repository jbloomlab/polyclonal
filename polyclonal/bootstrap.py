    Parameters
    -----------
    data_to_fit : pandas.DataFrame or None
        The full dataset to draw bootstrapped samples from.
        Should have columns named 'aa_substitutions', 'concentration', and
        'prob_escape'. The 'aa_substitutions' column defines each variant
        :math:`v` as a string of substitutions (e.g., 'M3A K5G'). The
        'prob_escape' column gives the :math:`p_v\left(c\right)` value for
        each variant at each concentration :math:`c`.
    n_samples : int
        The number of desired bootstrap samples to draw and :class:Polyclonal
        models to fit.
    activity_wt_df : pandas.DataFrame or None
        Should have columns named 'epitope' and 'activity', giving the names
        of the epitopes and the activity against epitope in the wildtype
        protein, :math:`a_{\rm{wt}, e}`.
    mut_escape_df : pandas.DataFrame or None
        Should have columns named 'mutation', 'epitope', and 'escape' that
        give the :math:`\beta_{m,e}` values (in the 'escape' column), with
        mutations written like "G7M".
    site_escape_df : pandas.DataFrame or None
        Use if you want to initialize all mutations at a given site to have
        the same :math:`\beta_{m,e}` values. In this case, columns should be
        'site', 'epitope', and 'escape'. This option is mutually exclusive
        with ``mut_escape_df``.
    n_epitopes : int or None
        If initializing with ``activity_wt_df=None``, specifies number
        of epitopes.


    Attributes
    -----------
    mutations : tuple
        All mutations for which we have escape values.
    data_to_fit : pandas.DataFrame or None
        Data to fit as passed when initializing this :class:`BinaryMap`.
    models : tuple
        Contains `n_samples` of the :class:`Polyclonal` models.
    unsampled_mutations : dictionary
        A dictionary that keeps track of which mutations are not seen by a model
        and how often they are not sampled across all models in the collection.

        @Zorian given that we'd like to use multiprocessing.Pool I can say from
        experience that your life will be much easier if you think about defining things
        as much as possible in terms of free functions. I suggest a function that takes
        a bootstrapped data set and spits out a re-initialized model like you describe here.
        Then fit_models can take a threads argument, initialize the pool, and then apply
        that free function repeatedly.
        Given this, I'm not sure that you need _populate_collection but I probably don't
        understand what you have in mind.

        @Erick okay, I do think this is a good idea and have adjusted things above.
        I guess one thing I'm confused by "free function" -- do you mean a non-member function here
        or just like, more modularized functions that would all get called here?
        Regardless, I have a seperate function that will:
         - Take in a dataframe for `data_to_fit` and then creates and fits a polyclonal model.
         - Re-creates this object without the attached data and just the params.
         - Returns this polyclonal object
        We don't need _populate_collection and I've removed it.

            * Each row would represent a variant in the "test" set.
            * Each column would be a summary statsitic of the model predictions

        sampling distribution for each beta in each epitope.
        @Zorian-- How do you propose reporting?

        @Erick-- The current altair heatmaps created by polyclonal objects are really nice.
        I Think we should keep this format, but creating a "bootstrapped" heatmap where we also give the variance of each beta as well.
        So when hovering over a mutation, the user would see the mean beta-values for each epitope (same as polyclonal now), as well as the variances for these means.
        For each mutation, include the number (or frequency) of times it was
        **not** sampled as well.
