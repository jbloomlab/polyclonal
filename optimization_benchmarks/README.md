# Optimization benchmarks

Various workflows for testing different optimization settings.

[Snakemake_opt_settings](Snakemake_opt_settings) runs a ``snakemake`` workflow that tests different optimization settings, and then [analyze_opt_settings.ipynb](analyze_opt_settings.ipynb) is a Jupyter notebook that analyzes the results.
